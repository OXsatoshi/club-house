# Exclusive Clubhouse

Welcome to the **Exclusive Clubhouse** project! This web application allows members to write anonymous posts that only the privileged can fully understand. Here’s what makes the Clubhouse special:

## Project Overview

The Exclusive Clubhouse is designed to offer a unique experience for members. While anyone can view the posts, only members of the Clubhouse can see the authors’ identities. For those on the outside, the stories remain shrouded in mystery, leaving them to wonder about the enigmatic authors behind each post.

## Features

- **Anonymous Posting**: Members can create and share posts without revealing their identity to the public.
- **Member Authentication**: A secure system that ensures only authorized members can access the full details of each post.
- **Private Author Visibility**: Inside the Clubhouse, members can see the author of each post, but this information is hidden from non-members.
- **Engaging Storytelling**: The platform is designed to spark curiosity and encourage the sharing of stories in a semi-private environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
